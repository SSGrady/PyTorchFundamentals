*Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers*

### What deep learning is good for ðŸ¤– âœ… 
* **Problems with long sets of rules**â€”when traditional approach fails, machine learning or deep learning may help
*  **Continually changing environments**â€”deep learning can adapt ('learn') to new scenarios
*  **Discovering insights within large collections of data**â€”can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 108 different kinds of fruits look like?

### What deep learning is (typically) not good for ðŸ¤– ðŸ›‘ 
* **When you need explainability**â€”the patterns learned by a deep learning model (weights and biases) are typically unexplainable by humans
* **When the traditional approach is a better option**â€”if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system
* **When errors are unacceptable**â€”since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable
* **When you don't have much data**â€”deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results
